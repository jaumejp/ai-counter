# Falling Object Detection System
This repository contains a project for detecting and counting objects falling from a platform using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The system processes a video to monitor the fall of objects and ensures accurate counting without duplicates. The project is implemented using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection.
