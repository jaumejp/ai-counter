# Falling Object Detection System
This repository contains a project for detecting and counting objects falling from a platform using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The system processes a video to monitor the fall of objects and ensures accurate counting without duplicates. The project is implemented using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection.

For easy reading and execution of the file, it can be viewed in Google Colab.
